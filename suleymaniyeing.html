                            The Süleymaniye Mosque, considered the masterpiece of the architect Sinan during his apprenticeship, was built between 1551 and 1558 under the command of Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. The Süleymaniye Mosque is one of the most important examples of Classical Ottoman Architecture. The mosque has four minarets, two with three balconies and two with two balconies, and its dome reaches a height of 53 meters.
        
                            <br><br>The mosque features a main dome, two semi-domes, two quarter domes, and ten small domes. The main dome rests on four elephant feet, and the dome arches are supported by four large granite columns. To enhance acoustics, 64 cylindrical containers, each 50 cm long, are placed inside the dome and in the corners with their mouths facing inward, creating precise acoustics. The mosque is noted for its work on the sultan's and muezzin's balconies, the minbar, and the mihrab, all of which are intricately crafted with granite and marble columns. The section on the right side of the muezzin's balcony, enclosed by metal grilles, was used as a library until 1918, when the existing books were moved to the General Library established at the Süleymaniye Madrasahs.
        
                            <br><br>In the front part of the mosque, there are colorful windows above the mihrab. These windows, made by the famous master Ibrahim Usta, are designed to make the sunlight passing through them resemble the "Wings of Gabriel" (Şehper-i Cibril) as envisioned by Mimar Sinan. The mosque contains four large, valuable granite columns, which were brought from Alexandria, Baalbek, the Kıztaşı in Istanbul, and the Saray-ı Amire. The mosque's floor is covered with marble, and it has a spacious inner courtyard surrounded by 28 domed porticos with three doors.
        
                            <br><br>The minarets, referred to as "mosque minarets" and "harem minarets," signify that Sultan Suleiman was the fourth sultan following the conquest of Istanbul and the tenth sultan of the Ottoman Empire with ten balconies. The minarets rising towards the sky resemble a person raising their hands in prayer. The inscriptions in the mosque are the work of the famous calligrapher Ahmet Karahisari and his student Hasan Çelebi. Later, Kazasker Mustafa Efendi also added some inscriptions. Except for a few, the texts of the inscriptions are intricately worked out and taken from the Quran. The inscription above the door leading from the inner courtyard to the mosque is divided into three sections: the first lists the qualities of Sultan Suleiman, the second describes his genealogy, and the third states the mosque's superior qualities, its purpose, and the time of its construction, along with prayers for the continuity of the sultanate and the souls of the ancestors.
        
                            <br><br>The mosque's garden, which covers approximately 6,000 square meters, has 11 doors. Surrounding the garden are seven madrasahs, known as the Süleymaniye Madrasahs, including five at the high school level, one at the faculty level, and one specialized department. The medical madrasah in the corner was formerly a maternity hospital, and the bimarhane opposite it was once a military printing house but now serves as a girls' Quran course. The buildings on the northern side of the mosque, which were initially used as a soup kitchen, later served as the Turkish-Islamic Arts Museum, and were transferred to the Süleymaniye Library in 1984.
