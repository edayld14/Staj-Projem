                            Rumeli Lighthouse Fortress, also known as Topçu Fortress, is a 17th-century fortress located on the Rumelifeneri ridges in Istanbul. It takes its name from the nearby village and the Rumeli Lighthouse. The fortress can be reached by traveling through the Rumelifeneri Village in the Sarıyer district. The lighthouse that gives the village its name has a long history, with fires lit since ancient times to guide sailors at the entrance to the Bosphorus.
        
                            <br><br>The village where the Rumeli Lighthouse is located was known as Fanariyan Burnu during the Byzantine period. This name translates to meanings such as "small lighthouse" and "European lighthouse," and was also known as Panyum Burnu in ancient times.
        
                            <br><br>The fortress, located at the farthest point on the Bosphorus from the Black Sea side, features an arched entrance gate. It was used as a military outpost during the Republic period. Today, the fortress is part of a First Degree Natural Site Area, as declared by the Cultural and Natural Heritage Protection Regional Board on March 12, 2008, under decision number 2938. The oldest record related to Rumeli Lighthouse Fortress is a document dated 1769/1183 found in the Ottoman State Archive of the Turkish Prime Ministry.
        
                            <br><br>The historical information about the fortress is not certain. It is claimed that it was first built by the Genoese in the 15th century, or possibly even earlier by the Byzantines. However, most sources indicate that it was constructed around 1769 by an unknown Greek engineer for the Ottoman Empire. It was later redesigned by French engineers Toussaint in 1783, Latife-Clavé in 1785, and Monnier in 1794.
        
                            <br><br>The fortress covers an area of 46,185 square meters. The plan consists of a rectangular shape with the northeastern and northwestern corners angled, featuring an arched main entrance on the southwestern wall, and octagonal towers on the southeastern and northwestern walls. The fortress, which offers a unique view, is constructed of masonry stone and is 55x70 meters in size. The structure incorporates different materials such as rough-hewn stone, rubble stone, and brick. All walls use rough-hewn stone in the corners and a combination of rough-hewn stone and rubble stone in between. The stones are sandstone and basalt. Various collapses occurred on the fortress walls in 1624. Under the decree of Sultan IV. Murad, who was on the throne at that time, repair work was carried out. The fortress had 60 soldier houses, 100 cannons, an ammunition depot, granaries, a mosque, and housed 300 soldiers.
        
                            <br><br>The lighthouse, located 58 meters above sea level and 30 meters long, was initially illuminated with kerosene and later with acetylene. Its light can be seen from a distance of 18 nautical miles.
