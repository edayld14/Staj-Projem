                            The Istanbul Greek Orthodox Patriarchate, also known as the Phanar Greek Orthodox Patriarchate or the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, is one of the 14 autocephalous churches of the Eastern Orthodox Church and holds the highest rank among them. It is currently led by the Archbishop of Constantinople and Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I.
                        
                            <br><br>Due to its location in the capital of the Byzantine Empire and its role as the main church for most Orthodox churches today, it holds a special place in the Orthodox denomination. The Ecumenical Patriarch is considered the "first among equals" among other Eastern Orthodox bishops and does not interfere with the fully autonomous autocephalous churches, unlike the Catholic Church. Despite this, he is recognized as the representative and spiritual leader of approximately 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide.
                            
                            <br><br>After the conquest of Istanbul in 1453, the regulations concerning the lives of non-Muslim communities were established by a decree issued by Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror, thereby solidifying the legal status of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate, also known as the Phanar Greek Orthodox Patriarchate. The content of the decree is as follows:
                            
                            <br><br>"No one shall oppress the Patriarch, and no one shall interfere with him, whoever they may be. He and the priests under his command shall be exempt from all services forever. Their churches shall not be converted into mosques. Marriages and burials, as well as other customs, shall be carried out according to Greek customs as before."
                            
                            <br><br>With the appointment of Patriarch II. Gennadios, the patriarchate began its activities in the Church of the Holy Apostles, the second-largest church in the city at the time. The church, which was about a thousand years old at that time, had the graves of the imperial family in its garden and was vacated in 1455 due to the decreasing Christian population and security concerns.
                            
                            <br><br>The patriarchate moved to the Pammakaristos Monastery. The Pammakaristos Monastery, built by II. Ioannes Komnenos in the 12th century, was located in the Çarşamba district, where Christian immigrants were settled. Being smaller and more secure compared to the Church of the Holy Apostles, Pammakaristos was restored in 1518 and expanded during the patriarchy of II. Ieremias. The church was vacated in 1586 during the reign of III. Murad and was converted into a mosque named Fethiye in 1591. The patriarchate moved first to the Virgin Mary Spring in Fener and then to the Church of Saint Demetrios in Ayvansaray in 1597.
                            
                            <br><br>In 1602, the patriarchate settled in the Church of Saint George in Fener, where it has remained ever since.
                            
                            <br><br>The Greek Orthodox patriarchs, whose status was determined by the decree issued by Mehmed II, supervised the community's customs such as marriage and burial. The patriarch was considered of vizier status and was given a seat in the council. Along with other administrators under his command, he was exempt from all services and taxes. The patriarch presided over the council where matters concerning the Greek community were discussed and had full authority in legal and criminal matters. Thus, the patriarch became the undisputed leader of the Greek Orthodox community, gaining more rights than he had during the Byzantine period.
