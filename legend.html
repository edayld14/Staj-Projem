              <p class="card-text">
                Columns found in various districts of Istanbul are monuments that carry Istanbul's historical, cultural, religious, and architectural texture from the dark periods of history to the present day. The legends formed around these columns have been narrated both orally and in written sources for centuries. In Derman Bayladı's book "Journey to History in the Heart of Istanbul: Monuments-Events-Legends," a variation of the following legend about Kıztaşı can also be found in oral sources:
                <br> During the construction of Hagia Sophia, a young girl was carrying a large column on her back to Hagia Sophia. Suddenly, a genie appeared in front of her and asked:
                <br>— Where are you taking this stone on your back? The girl replied to the genie:
                <br>— I heard that a church called Hagia Sophia is being built. I wanted to contribute, so I am carrying this stone there, she answered. The genie then said:
                <br>— You are late, the church is already finished. Leave that stone where you took it from. The girl was very upset but had no choice and brought the stone back, placing it upright where she had taken it. After a while, the girl grew suspicious. “The genie told me Hagia Sophia was finished, but let me go and see with my own eyes,” she thought. She went to Hagia Sophia and saw that the construction was not yet finished. Then she realized that the genie had deceived her. She returned to get the stone. But despite all her efforts, she could not move the stone. It turns out that the girl lost her magical power because she left the stone on the ground, believing the genie's words. Thus, the stone remained in its current place.
                <br> The mysterious columns of Istanbul, which bear the traces of pagan beliefs, are monuments reflecting the historical and cultural texture of the city from the dark periods of the past to the present. Located on Kıztaşı Street in Fatih, Kıztaşı is also known as the "Column of Marcian." It was erected by Governor Tatiatus in honor of Emperor Marcian (450-457) during the Byzantine period. With its capital, it has a total height of 17 meters. On the base with three steps, the northern face of the pedestal features two Victory Goddesses carrying a six-armed cross within a circle. The name "Kıztaşı" from the Ottoman period comes from these Victory Goddess reliefs.

              <p class="card-text">
                The Maiden's Tower, solitary in the Bosphorus, is a delicate pearl at the heart of Istanbul with its enchanting beauty. Galata Tower, on the other hand, is a majestic structure watching over Istanbul from above.
                As the Maiden's Tower glides alone in the Bosphorus, Galata Tower appears before her, with its majestic and enchanting stance. The two towers fall in love with each other in front of Istanbul, but they cannot unite. Because the Bosphorus is a barrier between them. As the impossible love makes the Maiden's Tower fade day by day, Galata Tower writes letters and poems to her.
                One day, Hezarfen Ahmet Çelebi climbs to the top of Galata Tower. His goal is to fly from there to Üsküdar. Unable to resist the persistence of Galata Tower, Çelebi decides to take the letters it has accumulated for centuries and fly. However, as he approaches the Salacak shore, the letters scatter due to the wind, but the waves deliver them to the Maiden's Tower. At that moment, the Maiden's Tower understands how much Galata Tower loves her.
                Realizing that their love is mutual, they become even more beautiful. Although they cannot unite, they have been living their love by gazing at each other for centuries… This legendary love, passed down from generation to generation, has brought an enchanting atmosphere to Istanbul's beauty. Now, with their colorful lanterns as bright as their stories, they can say "I love you" to each other in Morse code.

              <p class="card-text">
                The Süleymaniye Complex and Mosque, built by Mimar Sinan upon the order of Suleiman the Magnificent, is undoubtedly one of the masterpieces of Ottoman architecture. However, it would be insufficient to view the Süleymaniye Mosque, which has significant historical and architectural value, merely as an architectural work. Because architectural works that shape the identity of cities are valuable to the extent that the people living there appreciate them. Many legends have formed around the Süleymaniye Mosque within the oral cultural tradition, from the 16th century when the mosque was built to the present day, and these legends have been preserved in oral and written sources.
                In Osman Nuri Topbaş's work "The Ottoman Empire with Its Monumental Personalities and Institutions," the following enriched motif of a legend, which can also be found in oral sources, is narrated as follows:
                <br> When Suleiman the Magnificent decided to build the Süleymaniye Mosque, he saw the Prophet Muhammad in his dream one night. The Prophet Muhammad showed him where the mosque should be built and gave detailed instructions on the interior and exterior elements of the mosque:
                <br>— Place the pulpit here, the mihrab there, and the minbar there! He explained in detail. Waking up from this beautiful dream with great excitement and joy, Suleiman the Magnificent thanked Allah with tears of joy.
                <br> The next day, he immediately went to the place indicated by the Prophet Muhammad and called Mimar Sinan there, telling him that he wanted to build a mosque there. Mimar Sinan, as if already expecting this offer, told the Sultan:
                <br>— My Sultan! We will build the mosque in this way; the mihrab here, the pulpit there, and the minbar there, repeating the words of the Prophet Muhammad that Suleiman saw in his dream. Upon this, Suleiman smiled at Sinan and said:
                <br>— Chief Architect! You seem to be aware of my dream! he said.
                <br> Mimar Sinan, as if indicating that he had seen the same dream, said:
                <br>— My Sultan! I was there in your blessed dream last night, walking two steps behind you! he said.
                <br> Overjoyed and excited, Suleiman immediately ordered:
                <br>— Then let the construction of the mosque begin at once! The Chief Architect Koca Sinan, who had already been waiting for this order, quickly made his preparations and started the construction of the great mosque, with Sheikh ul-Islam Ebusuud Efendi laying the first stone in the foundation.
                <br> Such legends, which have been told around mosques for centuries and passed down from generation to generation, play a very important role in spreading the moral values of Islam among the people, ensuring the continuity of social memory, and preserving the identity of Istanbul as a "Muslim Turkish" city.

              <p class="card-text">
                Many legends about the founding of Istanbul can be found in written and oral sources. Some of these legends are mentioned in Hans Hermann Russack's article "Istanbul and Its Legends." In this article, the following legend about the founding of Istanbul is narrated:
                <br> When the site for the founding of Istanbul was chosen, two signs appeared, as prophesied by the wise men. The first sign was an eagle flying towards the direction of the Bosphorus and landing on the other shore. The second sign was a glowing angel flying towards the land. The wise men interpreted these signs as follows:
                <br>— The eagle represents power and sovereignty. Therefore, the place where the eagle lands is the heart of the future city, the center of sovereignty.
                <br>— The angel, with its heavenly glow, indicates where the people will be enlightened with wisdom and spirituality.
                Based on these signs, the city of Istanbul was founded, centered on the area where the eagle landed and extending towards the place indicated by the angel.
                <br> Such legends, passed down through generations, enhance the cultural richness and mystique of Istanbul, giving it a unique historical significance.

              <p class="card-text">During the conquest of Istanbul, the Byzantines placed thick chains across the Bosphorus. The Ottoman fleet, which would play a crucial role in the conquest, could not be launched into the sea, delaying the conquest and causing the army to lose hope day by day. In this state of despair, Mehmet II fell asleep in his tent, and in his dream, he saw the Prophet Muhammad. The Prophet told Mehmet II to move the ships overland and showed him the route to follow. Upon waking, the Sultan immediately called his viziers, told them about his dream, and ordered work to begin on implementing this idea. At the same time, Mehmet II placed Quran reciters with melodious voices along the Bosphorus to recite Surah Al-Fath, and he organized continuous prayers seeking Allah's help. In this spiritual atmosphere, it is said that along with the janissaries, invisible spiritual soldiers also helped pull the ships on sleds from Kağıthane to the sea. Thus, the mighty Ottoman fleet was moved overland and launched into the sea overnight. The next morning, seeing the Ottoman fleet before them, the Byzantines were struck dumb and realized that saving Istanbul was no longer possible.

                During the reign of Yavuz Sultan Selim, a shepherd was grazing his sheep in the area where the grave is now located. The sheep grazed peacefully but avoided stepping directly on the spot where Joshua's grave lay, instead grazing around it. Unable to understand why, the shepherd had a dream one night in which he saw the Prophet Joshua. In the dream, Joshua asked the shepherd to go to Yavuz Sultan Selim and request that the Sultan build a shrine over the grave. The next day, influenced by the dream, the shepherd went to the Sultan, told him about the dream, and as a result, Yavuz Sultan Selim built a shrine for Prophet Joshua on this hill in Beykoz. He also appointed the shepherd as the caretaker of the shrine. The grave of Prophet Joshua, which surpasses human dimensions, is located in the courtyard of the mosque there.
