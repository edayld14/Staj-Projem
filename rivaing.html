                        <div class="accordion-body col-sm">Although the exact date of the castle's construction is unknown, it is believed to have been built during the Byzantine period due to its general structure and the materials used. The earliest mention of the castle is from the 1780s, referred to as "Revancık Castle." It is said to have been built to control access from the Black Sea to the Riva Stream and to ensure coastal security. Greek mythology mentions that Jason, the leader of the Argonauts, took an iron anchor from the Riva Stream while searching for the Golden Fleece, and thus it is suggested that the area was called "Ancyranum" during the Byzantine period.

                            <br><br>Boucicaut mentions that in 1399, he captured a castle located on the shore of a stream flowing into the Black Sea on the Anatolian side of Istanbul. It is thought that the castle Boucicaut captured was Riva Castle. However, this information is not certain. Although Evliya Çelebi mentioned some castles around the Istanbul Bosphorus, he did not mention a castle in Riva. The Istanbul Encyclopedia notes that in the 1600s, the fortifications on the Bosphorus were attacked by Cossacks and Russians, and during the reign of IV. Murad, two new castles named "Bağdadcık" and "Revancık" were built due to these attacks. Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall, in a book he wrote about Istanbul and the Bosphorus at the end of the 19th century, describes the castle as an "abandoned castle" and states that it was built to prevent an attack from the interior of Asia to the Bosphorus. Due to the lack of clear information in earlier sources about the castle, it is thought that the castle might have been built around the 17th to 18th centuries.
        
                            <br><br>During the Ottoman period, the castle was used for defense against threats from the Black Sea. During the reign of III. Mustafa, due to supply issues experienced in Istanbul during the Ottoman-Russian War of 1768-1774, efforts were made to fortify the Istanbul Bosphorus. To defend the castle, a thousand soldiers selected from the Black Sea region were assigned. These soldiers, mostly of Laz and Çepni origin, were granted certain privileges such as marriage, setting up homes, and owning gardens due to the castle's distance from Beykoz. Under Ottoman rule, the castle underwent maintenance and repair work during various periods.
        
                            <br><br>During the occupation of Istanbul, the castle was damaged by British forces and served as a cafeteria for a period. Today, it is used for tourism purposes. In 2016, the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality tendered for the restoration of the castle. The restoration work included cleaning the castle walls and joints, and repairing cracks in the walls with stone and brick work.
