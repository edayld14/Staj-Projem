                        <div class="accordion-body col-sm">After the naval victory at Kyzikos, in 408 BC, Athenian general Alcibiades likely built a special station on a small rock in front of Üsküdar, probably for ships coming from the Black Sea.

                            <br><br>The tower, which has become a symbol of Üsküdar, is the only surviving Byzantine structure in Üsküdar. It has a history that dates back to 24 BC.
                        
                            <br><br>In 1110, Byzantine Emperor Alexios I built a wooden tower protected by stone walls. A chain was stretched from this tower to another tower erected in the Mangana district of Constantinople (a neighborhood in the historical peninsula). The islet was later connected to the Asian shore by a defensive wall, some remnants of which are still visible underwater. During the Ottoman conquest of Istanbul in 1453, the tower housed a Byzantine garrison commanded by the Venetian Gabriele Trevisano. Later, the structure was used as a watchtower by the Ottoman Turks during the reign of Fatih Sultan Mehmed.
                        
                            <br><br>Originally hosting a tomb during the Greek period, this islet was used as a customs station with an additional building constructed during the Byzantine period. During the Ottoman period, it served many functions including a display platform, defensive fortress, exile station, and quarantine room. However, it has never lost its original function of guiding ships with its beacon, which has been a constant feature for centuries.
                        
                            <br><br>Some European historians refer to this as the Leander Tower. There are many legends about the tower. In ancient times, it was known by names such as "arkla" (small castle) and "damialis" (calf), and it was also once famous as "Tour de Leandros" (Leander's Tower). Today, it is integrated with the name Maiden's Tower and is known by this name.
                        
                            <br><br>With its very ancient history, Maiden's Tower was once used to collect taxes from ships passing through the Bosphorus. A large chain was stretched across from the tower to the European side, allowing ships to pass between the Anatolian side and the Maiden's Tower (at that time, ships were small enough to pass through). Eventually, the tower could no longer support the chain and collapsed toward the European side. The ruins can be seen when looking into the water from the tower.
                        
                            <br><br>The tower was destroyed in the 1509 earthquake, rebuilt, and then burned in 1721. It was ordered to be repaired by Grand Vizier Damat İbrahim Pasha, and the new building was used as a lighthouse; the surrounding walls were repaired in 1731 and 1734. Finally, in 1763, the tower was rebuilt with more durable stone. From 1829, it was used as a quarantine station and was restored again by Sultan Mahmud II in 1832. In 1945, the tower came under the jurisdiction of the port authority for maintenance. It was later restored again in 1998 and appeared in the James Bond film "The World Is Not Enough" shortly before.
