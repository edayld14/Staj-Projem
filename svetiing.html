                            During the Ottoman Empire, Bulgarians, as part of the Orthodox Christian community of the Rum Millet, prayed in the churches of the Phanar Orthodox Patriarchate. However, the 19th-century Bulgarian nationalist movement advocated for the establishment of a separate Bulgarian state. As they viewed the Phanar Patriarchate largely as a Greek institution, the creation of a separate Bulgarian religious organization was proposed for Bulgarian Orthodox Christians. These efforts resulted in the recognition of the Bulgarian Exarchate by Ottoman Sultan Abdulaziz through a decree in 1870.
                        
                            <br><br>The richly decorated church is a basilica in a cross shape with three domes. The mihrab faces the Golden Horn, and a 40-meter-high bell tower with six bells cast in Yaroslavl rises above the narthex. On the shores of the Golden Horn, between the Balat and Fener squares (near Eyüp District), a small wooden church was originally erected at the site of the current church. A house was donated by statesman Stefan Bogoridi and reorganized as a wooden church. It was opened on October 9, 1849, and became an important site of the Bulgarian National Revival. The Ottoman imperial decree dated February 28, 1870, establishing the Bulgarian Exarchate, was first read in this church. After the original wooden structure was damaged by fire, a larger building was constructed in its place. Due to poor ground conditions, an iron frame was preferred over reinforced concrete. The architectural plans were prepared by Ottoman Armenian architect Hovsep Aznavur.
                        
                            <br><br>An international competition was held for the production of the prefabricated cast iron parts of the church, which was won by the Austrian company R. Ph. Waagner. The 500 tons of prefabricated elements were produced in Vienna between 1893 and 1896 and transported to Istanbul by ships across the Danube and Black Sea.
                        
                            <br><br>One and a half years later, the church was completed in 1898 and was opened by Exarch Joseph on September 8 of that year. The main structure of the church is made of steel and covered with metal plates. All parts are connected by nuts, bolts, rivets, or welding. Architecturally, the church combines Neo-Gothic and Neo-Baroque influences.
                        
                            <br><br>St. Stephen's Church was the product of 19th-century experiments with prefabricated iron churches. The British, who invented corrugated iron in 1829, produced portable iron churches for distant colonies such as Australia. French engineer Gustave Eiffel, creator of the Eiffel Tower, designed iron churches sent as far as the Philippines and Peru. Today, St. Stephen's Church is one of the few surviving prefabricated cast iron churches in the world.
